# Network Data

This is a library intended to help with manipulating, querying, and analyzing
networked data structures.

What is networked data? Any data type that has nodes that are connected to other
nodes via edges.

If you found this library, you are probably aware of many data structures that
are networked data structures: Trees, Linked Lists, Doubly Linked Lists, Graphs,
Dependency Trees, etc.

The great thing about network style data is that almost EVERYTHING natural can
be modeled with a networked data structure, such as:

3D models, Maps, Dependencies, Lists, scatter plots, 2D plots, social graphs,
banking data, transactions, step by step directions, project planning, chemical
reactions, atoms, biology, history....just about ANYTHING.

The disadvantage to Network style data: it can model EVERYTHING. It makes it a
complex and difficult data structure to work with, making it difficult to
explore and experiment with interactions or patterns within the data.

Thus, I made this library to simplify common steps and challenges and help a
developer get to the heart of discovery within this data structure.

As time progresses, this library will offer these tools:

- A means to model and manipulate networked data
- The ability to query the networked data in meaningful ways
- The tools to visualize your networked data in a multitude of exploratory
  manners in order to really see how the data interacts within itself and
  hopefully derive meaningful patterns.
